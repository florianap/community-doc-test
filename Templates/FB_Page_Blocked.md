# Facebook - Page Blocked
## Initial email to client about a Facebook page blocked due to an alias

### Body

Hi [Client's Name],

My name is [IH's Name] from the Access Now Digital Security Helpline, and we are happy to help you.

I was reading your request and in this particular case we need to know if you have already tried to change your name to the original one or to revoke the suspension of your account through the official Facebook form: https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/260749603972907

We need to know this to decide which is the best way to proceed.

Thank you,

[IH's Name]
