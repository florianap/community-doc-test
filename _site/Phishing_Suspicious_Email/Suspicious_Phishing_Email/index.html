<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>

<p>The email may contain malware or a link to a malicious site that tricks the
client into disclosing personal information.</p>

<p>The longer a malevolent website stays online, the more victims it will create.
Reporting this website is one of the most important steps the Helpline can take.</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Protect the client, and respond to their concerns.</p>

    <p>Be sure to clearly state the email <em>should not be opened, nor a linked site
visited</em>. Use your response to ask for the full headers of the email.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.circl.lu/pub/tr-07/">This link</a> may be used to assist the client in locating the full headers for many
email clients (including Gmail, Yahoo, Thunderbird, and Outlook).</p>

    <p>If you need the raw email message (including attachments), consider sending the
client <a href="https://www.circl.lu/pub/tr-34/">this link</a> to help them.</p>

    <p>The template for this step may be found <a href="../Templates/Phishing-First_Email.md">here</a></p>

    <p>NOTE: If the client has already visited a site, or opened an attachment, we
should increase the urgency and impact of the case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ask if the supposed sender is known to the client.</p>
  </li>
  <li>After receiving the headers and full email source from the client in Step 1, analyze the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Where is the email coming from? From what Country, ISP, IP address?</li>
      <li>Is the IP address part of the Tor network? Check <a href="https://www.dan.me.uk/tornodes">this link</a></li>
      <li>Are there any links in the email?
        <ul>
          <li>Where are those links pointing to?</li>
          <li>If you believe it to be in good judgment, get the full content of the site using WGET and/or CURL. Be sure to conceal your identity using Tor. (On Linux, use the command <code class="highlighter-rouge">torify wget -qO- -U curl ifconfig.me</code> to check your IP.)</li>
          <li>Where is the domain registered?</li>
          <li>Is a file downloaded on the link?</li>
          <li>Is the website asking for personal information?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Are there any attachments?
        <ul>
          <li>Be careful opening the attachments.</li>
          <li>Use a virtual machine for the analysis.</li>
          <li>Run them through an antivirus.</li>
          <li>Open docs or PDFs on web services.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Use this <a href="https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/messageheader/">header analysis tool</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>If the suspicious email was identified as Gmail scam, Please follow <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/1074268?hl=en">this link</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Communicate to the client the conclusions of your investigation, and if
necessary, report the website.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Take Down a Corrupted Domain</strong>
When there is a phishing website, it is important to get the page off of the
internet to avoid having more victims.</p>

<p>One way to do it is to follow the instructions offered by <a href="www.circl.lu">Circl CERT team</a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Paste the link in <a href="https://www.circl.lu/urlabuse/">this page</a> to receive all the contact points from the whois entries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Send to <em>all contacts</em> listed an email notifying them of the malicious
content found on one of their domains. An example of what this email could look like may be found in <a href="../Templates/Phishing_Link.md">Template #209 - Phishing Link</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
