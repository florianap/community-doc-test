<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>

<p>A user at risk has received a phishing message by email or through a social
networking platform.</p>

<p>The message seems targeted and might be aimed at the single user or at a certain
group of the civil society.</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Analyze the case and possibly gather more information on similar incidents to
evaluate if the phishing attack is targeted.</p>

    <p>Among the things we should consider to confirm the hypothesis of
 spearphishing, we should look for:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A customized text, containing information on the user or other signs of
social engineering.</li>
      <li>The usage of the user’s language, especially if it’s a dialect.</li>
      <li>We can confirm that the phishing campaign is targeting in particular
members of the civil society.</li>
      <li>Any attempt to gather information on the target (phone number, email
address, login id).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the suspicion of spear-phishing is confirmed by some of the above
elements, but only few cases have been observed, we can try to gather more
evidence by writing to intermediaries selected according to the area where the
campaign has taken place or, if the campaign is not restricted to one area, by
getting in touch with all intermediaries and partners that may be interested in
this kind of attack.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>When writing to intermediaries to gather evidence on a possible spear-phishing
campaign, we should use <a href="../Templates/spear-phishing-evidence-gathering.md">this
template</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>If the phishing attack is confirmed:
    <ul>
      <li>If the attack is based on email messages, we should proceed as described
in Article #58 to analyze the email and report any suspicious website or
IP.</li>
      <li>If the attack is launched through a social networking website, we should
follow the specific escalation guidelines of the involved platform to help
recover any hacked account, as well as report any malicious account
involved. <strong>In no case should we request the platform to disclose the
attacker’s IP address</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

  <li>More information on targeted phishing attacks can be found in  Citizen Lab’s
<a href="https://targetedthreats.net/">Targeted Threats report</a>, specifically in the
<a href="https://targetedthreats.net/media/5-Appendix.pdf">appendix</a>, which lays out
an easy way to “grade” a communication on how targeted and customized an
attack is.</li>
