<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>

<p>Organizations don’t always know exactly what their main risks are. In other situations, what an organization considers to be the highest risk is not actually their main issue. Understanding what is important for an organization, and what their risks are, is key to successfully improving their digital security.</p>

<p>Through this article, we aim to provide guidance to incident handlers in performing a light risk assessment for Helpline clients.</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>In order to prioritize the digital security work that needs to be done, there are important questions that must be answered. However, obtaining responses to these questions is not usually as simple as asking directly.</p>

<p>Clients will not always understand what we are asking. You should form appropriate questions uniquely for each client. Keep in mind that you are looking for the necessary information to reply to all of the questions. Try to make this a conversation rather than only a question and answer session.</p>

<p>Before arranging a call with the client, do your own investigation. Look for information on their website, try to understand what work the organization is doing. The more prepared you are before talking directly with the client, the more important details you will be able to obtain. Make sure you take detailed notes during the call or meeting.</p>

<p>After gathering all of this information from the client, you should have enough details to understand what threats are more likely for the organization to face. These most likely threats will serve as a starting point for you to draft a remediation plan solving the most critical issues first.</p>

<p>Coordinate with your contact from the organization to decide how to best work with them for the remediation phase.</p>
