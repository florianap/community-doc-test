<p>Hi [Client’s Name],</p>

<p>My name is [IH’s Name] from the Access Now Digital Security Helpline, and we are happy to help you.</p>

<p>I was reading your request and in this particular case we need to know if you have already tried to change your name to the original one or to revoke the suspension of your account through the official Facebook form: https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/260749603972907</p>

<p>We need to know this to decide which is the best way to proceed.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>
