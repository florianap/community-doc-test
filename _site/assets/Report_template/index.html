<ul>
  <li>How will we, the organization, and potentially other partners coordinate to address the challenges found in the last section? Create a bulleted list addressing each concern individually.</li>
  <li>Plan to address the most pressing needs first. Be sure to list who will lead that effort, and how (if at all) our Helpline team will be involved. If there will be external partners involved, please note what their tasks and expectations are.</li>
  <li>Consider the following categories: Security Awareness, Secure Cloud Storage, Email Account Security, Social Media Account Security, Device Access and Encryption, Safe Travel Advice, DDoS Protection, [Advice] Physical Security</li>

<ul>
  <li>After providing the consultation report to the client, solicit their feedback on the remediation steps proposed and the prioritization of those steps.</li>
  <li>If the client agrees on them, then create the child cases and update the plan with those ticket numbers.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="remediation-plan-1">Remediation Plan</h2>

<p>In order to address the challenges presented above, the Helpline is available to assist [$ORGANIZATION] with the design, prioritization, and implementation of a remediation plan. There may also be other implementing partners whom [$ORGANIZATION] would like assistance from instead.</p>

<p>We recommend [$ORGANIZATION] IT staff lead the implementation of the remediation plan, and ensure they have adequate buy-in and support from the rest of the organization to implement these new organizational practices.</p>

<p>If the plan is accepted, the Helpline will create dedicated threads with [$ORGANIZATION] staff for each remediation topic and include associated information to support implementation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>TOPIC #1 [accessnow #CASE NUMBER]</li>
  <li>TOPIC #2 [accessnow #CASE NUMBER]</li>
