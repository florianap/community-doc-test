<h2 id="best-and-secure-circumvention-tools-tor-vpn-tails">Best and secure circumvention tools, Tor, VPN, Tails</h2>

<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The traffic can be monitored by the government on different points of the
path.</li>
  <li>The client is suffering from online censorship.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>We need to understand the exact needs of the client, even if they have already
mentioned a specific tool.</p>

<p>There are different ways of circumventing Internet censorship, some of which
provide additional layers of security. The tool that is most appropriate for the
client depends on their threat model and their specific need.</p>

<h4 id="initial-evaluation">Initial evaluation</h4>

<p>We need to assess and understand the threats the client is facing, and evaluate
how we can respond.</p>

<h5 id="questions-for-the-client">Questions for the client</h5>

<ul>
  <li>What is the client’s primary need? Are they interested only in circumvention,
or are privacy and anonymity also important?</li>
  <li>What data is being censored that the client wants to view? What is the
censorship context of his/her country?</li>
  <li>What appropriate tools are available and work in their country?</li>
  <li>In certain repressive regimes, the usage of VPNs or other tools might be
illegal. If you are unsure, you can involve the policy team for guidance, and
consult with Helpline management.</li>
  <li>If the client is asking how to hide their identity:
    <ul>
      <li>We need to know what they want to hide: just IP location, internet navigation, or more?</li>
      <li>Why do they need to hide their identity?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h4>

<p>These are best practices we should explain to the client:</p>

<p>At first, we need to advise the client to use <strong>HTTPS</strong> - the secure version of
the HTTP protocol used to access websites.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">This HTTPS Everywhere plug-in may be an easy install</a></p>

<p>In addition to the obvious benefits of HTTPS, there is a chance that the
encrypted version of the site is not blocked.</p>

<p>Check if the mobile and laptop website versions are both blocked.</p>

<p>For example, instead of visiting https://twitter.com, the client could try to visit https://m.twitter.com,
the mobile version of the site. Censors that block websites or web pages usually
work from a blacklist of banned websites, so anything that is not on that
blacklist will get through.</p>

<p><strong>What follows is a list of some circumvention tools listed from a higher risk threat model to lower:</strong></p>

<h5 id="warning-for-every-tor-based-tool">Warning for every Tor-based tool</h5>

<p>Before starting to use Tor, the client should check that their connections are
really anonymised: https://check.torproject.org/</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en#warning">More warnings</a></p>

<p>What the client should know in a nutshell:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t open documents downloaded through Tor while online. These documents can
contain Internet resources that will be downloaded outside of Tor by the
application that opens them.</li>
  <li>Web browsing is much slower than through a normal browser or a VPN because
your traffic is encrypted and relayed through the Tor network, but it shouldn’t
be crippling. If you find it’s too slow, you can try to change the circuit in
Tor Browser with Ctrl+Shift+L (with Orbot you can switch to a new identity by
swiping from right to left or from left to right on the onion icon)  - 
https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/8673/tor-browser-bundle-tbb-new-circuit-versus-new-identity</li>
  <li>Flash and many other features of websites won’t work, for example you may not
be able to watch videos - this is a drawback, but enabling these features may
compromise your anonymity. Some websites, including Youtube, support HTML5
players when Flash is not supported by the browser and sometimes you can watch
the video by switching to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/html5">HTML5 version</a>.</li>
  <li>You shouldn’t log into accounts that can identify you through Tor, and you
should switch off geolocation if you’re using a device that supports it.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t disactivate default plugins and don’t install other plugins in Tor Browser or
in Orfox/Orweb - use the default settings</p>

<h4 id="tor-browser">Tor Browser</h4>

<p><strong>Tor Browser</strong> is software that protects you by bouncing your communications
around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world.
In certain locations, where connections are slow, it might be difficult to
establish the circuit through the Tor network.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Tor Browser lets you use Tor on Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux without
needing to install any additional software. It can run off of a USB flash drive</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Official website</a></li>
  <li>Security in a Box has an updated guide on Tor Browser:

    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h5 id="warnings-2">Warnings</h5>

<p>Please keep in mind that if you’re using Tor Browser, only your activity within
the Tor Browser is encrypted and anonymised - any other internet traffic is not.
Other applications, like Skype or the regular browsers, will not be routed
through the Tor network, even if the Tor Browser is running.</p>

<h4 id="orbot">Orbot</h4>

<p><strong>Orbot</strong> is an anonymity tool for Android devices. It is needed to launch Tor in Android phones and tablets, before you use Orfox (see below).</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/">Website</a></li>
  <li>Security in a box <a href="https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/orbot/android/">guide on Orbot</a></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="warnings-3">Warnings</h5>

<ul>
  <li>If you use Orbot, by default only applications aware of Orbot such as Orfox
will be anonymised.</li>
  <li>You can also run Orbot in “VPN Mode” which will route all phone traffic 
through Tor. Be aware that there is a lot of identifying information that
applications (and your phone) transmit, so this is not a sufficient way to 
achieve anonymity on the phone. To enable the “VPN Mode”, open the side panel
and click on the button next to “Apps VPN Mode”.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>If needed we can mention that you can also torify your connections for some
selected apps that are not anonymised by default [Settings –&gt; Select Apps in
v.15.2], but this requires root privileges on your device, so it’s more
difficult and shouldn’t be recommended to non experts.</em></p>

<h4 id="orfox">Orfox</h4>

<p>A browser for Android devices that can be used to browse the Internet anonymously
together with Orbot (see above).</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://guardianproject.info/apps/orfox/">Website</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Orfox is built from the same source code as Tor Browser (which is built upon
Firefox), but with a few minor modifications to the privacy enhancing features
to make them compatible with Firefox for Android and the Android operating
system.</p>

<h5 id="warnings-4">Warnings</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Use of Orfox is at your own risk; remember that sensitive data does not always
belong on a mobile device. See warnings for Orbot above.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="onion-browser">Onion Browser</h4>

<p><strong>Onion Browser</strong> is a free web browser for iPhone and iPad that encrypts and
tunnels web traffic through the Tor network, with extra features to help you
browse the internet privately.</p>

<p>Available only for iOS.</p>

</ul>

<h5 id="warnings-5">Warnings:</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Only connections through the Onion Browser are anonymised. Other applications
will not be routed through the Tor network, even if the Onion Browser is
running.</li>
  <li>Multimedia content often bypasses Tor and compromises your privacy; video files and
video streams are blocked by default and are not supported by the Onion Browser.</li>
  <li>Use of the Onion Browser is at your own risk; remember that sensitive
data does not always belong on a mobile device.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="vpns">VPNs</h4>

<p>A <strong>VPN</strong> encrypts and sends all Internet data between your computer and another
computer. A VPN protects your traffic from being intercepted locally, but your
VPN provider can keep logs of your traffic (websites you access, and when you
access them). These logs could trace back to you, and if your adversary is
powerful enough, they could pressure VPN providers to disclose this information.</p>

<p>It is very important to trust the VPN provider you use. We have contacts with some providers who can offer free accounts to civil society members. Some options are listed below:</p>

<h5 id="mullvad">Mullvad</h5>

<p><strong>Mullvad</strong> is a VPN which incorporates some obfuscation tech.</p>

<h4 id="circumvention-tools-based-on-encrypted-proxies">Circumvention Tools Based on Encrypted Proxies</h4>

<p>These are proxy tools that utilize encryption. Although the connection is
encrypted, it might be traced back to you: these tools do not
provide anonymity. They are, however, more secure than a plain web-based proxy.
Examples of these tools include Lantern and Psiphon.</p>

<h5 id="psiphon">Psiphon</h5>

<p><strong>Psiphon</strong> is a circumvention system that uses a combination of
secure communication and obfuscation technologies.</p>

<ol>

<h5 id="lantern">Lantern</h5>

<p><strong>Lantern</strong> is an Internet proxy tool. Its goal is to provide access to the open
internet. Lantern is unique because it uses peer connections as a source of
internet connectivity when servers are unavailable.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Available for Mac, Windows, Android, and Linux Debian-based distributions.</li>
  <li><a href="https://getlantern.org/">Website</a></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="web-based-proxies">Web-based Proxies</h4>

<p>This is a good way of circumventing censorship. Basically you route your HTTP
requests through a different computer (the proxy). The user must be careful,
since there are malicious proxy servers, capable of rerouting and modifying
users’ requests for malicious purposes.</p>

<p>Never use or trust a proxy server no one has ever heard of. And even if you
receive the proxy from a trusted partner, play it safe and do not pass on any
private information that isn’t encrypted.</p>
